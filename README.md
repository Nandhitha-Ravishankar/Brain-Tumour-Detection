Early diagnosis of brain tumors plays an important role in a patientâ€™s treatment and makes it easy to save his/her life. The conventional method of manually detecting brain tumors from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be problematic and erroneous. This paper presents an automatic brain tumor detection using CNN and also have performed Image Processing to analyse and understand the images. An accuracy of 61.25% was obtained. A GUI was created on MATLAB to visualise the analysis outputs for the images.
